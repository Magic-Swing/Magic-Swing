                <h2>Basic information for you:</h2>
             <h2 style="color: indigo; " ><b>1. What is the Stock Market?</b></h2>
             <p>The stock market is a platform where people can buy and sell shares (or "stocks") of publicly traded companies. It’s a way for companies to raise money (by selling stocks) and for investors to potentially make money by owning a portion of these companies.</p>
             <h2 style="color: indigo; "><b>2. Key Terms to Know</b></h2> 
             <p> Stock/Share: A unit of ownership in a company.<br>
                Stock Exchange: A marketplace where stocks are bought and sold. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ.
                 <br>Ticker Symbol: A unique series of letters assigned to each stock for identification (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
                 <br>Broker: A professional or platform that helps you buy and sell stocks.
                Dividend: A payment made by a company to its shareholders, typically from profits.</p>
             </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h2 style="color: indigo; "><b>3.Types of Stocks</b></h2> 
                <p>Common Stock: Gives shareholders voting rights and potential dividends.<br>
                    Preferred Stock: Doesn’t typically give voting rights but provides a fixed dividend and priority over common stock in case of liquidation.</p>
                </div>
                <div  class="card">
                  <h2>Candles</h2>  
                 <p>Stock market candles, often referred to as candlestick charts, are a popular method used to visualize price movements in financial markets. <br>Each "candlestick" represents a specific time period (e.g., a minute, hour, day) and provides four key pieces of information: the open, high, low, and close prices during that period. The candlestick has a rectangular body that shows the range between the opening and closing prices. If the close price is higher than the open, the body is typically filled with a lighter color, such as white or green, indicating a bullish (upward) movement. Conversely, if the close price is lower than the open, the body is filled with a darker color, like black or red, signaling a bearish (downward) trend. The lines extending from the body are known as "wicks" or "shadows" and represent the highest and lowest prices reached during the period. Candlestick patterns can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements, and traders often use them in combination with other indicators to make informed decisions.</p>

                  <h2>Candle Tail</h2> 
                  <p>In stock market candlestick charts, the "tail" (or "wick") refers to the thin line extending from the body of the candle, representing the highest and lowest prices during a specific time period. The top of the upper tail shows the highest price, while the bottom of the lower tail shows the lowest price. A long upper tail indicates strong upward price movement that was later rejected, while a long lower tail signals a strong downward movement followed by a recovery. The length and position of the tails can offer insights into market sentiment, with longer tails often suggesting increased volatility or uncertainty.</p>
